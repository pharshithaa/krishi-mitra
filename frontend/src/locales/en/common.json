Key points:\n\nâ€¢ **Sowing**: October-December\nâ€¢ **Temperature**: 15-25Â°C optimal\nâ€¢ **Rainfall**: 300-400mm required\nâ€¢ **Soil**: Well-drained loamy soil, pH 6.0-7.5\nâ€¢ **Harvest**: March-April\n\nWheat requires cool, dry weather during grain filling. Avoid excessive moisture during maturity to prevent fungal diseases.",
      "rice": "Rice is primarily grown during Kharif season (June-November). Details:\n\nâ€¢ **Sowing**: June-July\nâ€¢ **Temperature**: 20-35Â°C\nâ€¢ **Rainfall**: 1000-2000mm\nâ€¢ **Soil**: Clayey, waterlogged conditions\nâ€¢ **Harvest**: October-November\n\nRice requires high humidity and standing water. Transplanting is done 20-25 days after sowing.",
      "fertilizer": "General fertilizer recommendations:\n\nâ€¢ **NPK ratio**: Varies by crop and soil test\nâ€¢ **Timing**: Split application for better efficiency\nâ€¢ **Organic**: Compost, FYM improve soil health\nâ€¢ **Micronutrients**: Zinc, iron often deficient\n\nAlways conduct soil testing before fertilizer application for best results.",
      "pest": "Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach:\n\nâ€¢ **Prevention**: Crop rotation, resistant varieties\nâ€¢ **Monitoring**: Regular field inspection\nâ€¢ **Biological**: Beneficial insects, biopesticides\nâ€¢ **Chemical**: Last resort, follow label instructions\nâ€¢ **Cultural**: Proper spacing, sanitation\n\nEarly detection and prevention are key to effective pest management.",
      "general": "I'd be happy to help with your agricultural question! Here are some general principles:\n\nâ€¢ **Soil health**: Regular testing and organic matter addition\nâ€¢ **Water management**: Efficient irrigation and drainage\nâ€¢ **Crop selection**: Choose varieties suited to your climate\nâ€¢ **Timing**: Follow local agricultural calendars\nâ€¢ **Integrated approach**: Combine traditional and modern practices\n\nFor specific guidance, please consult your local agricultural extension officer or provide more details about your farming context."
